This is a github REPO to show my knowledge in ML


This is also used to share how I learned ML

Curent Knowledge

-Linear Regression
-Gradient Descent
-Logistic Regression(still learning the concept)
-Neural Networks(understood forward propagation and activation function, too learn the backpropagation concept)

Linear Regression And Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is basically going in the  direction that mins error 

a(n+1)=a(n) - u Grad(E(a(n)))

where ,
    a(i) is the prediction at ith iteration
    u is learning rate
    Grad() is gradient
